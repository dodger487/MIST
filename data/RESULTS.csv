2014-07-23 18:24:30,Boris's original algorithm,97.0,7.0,228.0,97.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,132.0,0.0,4.0,89.0
2014-07-25 17:28:12,Now using snippets of samples instead of everything and halved the window size on the algorithm also using S4 instead of S3,233.0,5.0,226.0,94.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,132.0,139.0,5.0,84.0
2014-07-25 19:03:12,using time instead of samples,310.0,0.0,149.0,94.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,132.0,216.0,0.0,7.0
2014-07-28 12:01:42,t1=85.6 t2=32.99 segment_time=200ms found via optimization on t1 t2 and segment_time,376.0,43.0,83.0,103.0,10.0,1.0,51.0,15.0,81.0,222.0,18.0,1.0
2014-08-07 18:00:48,Trying a vector-based method that actually works on the HTC1. If the difference between the current values and 5ms in the past is roughly [-3 18 6] it is a trigger event,94.0,6.0,365.0,0.0,3.0,104.0,94.0,2.0,38.0,0.0,1.0,223.0
